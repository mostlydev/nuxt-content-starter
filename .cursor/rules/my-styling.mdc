# Styling guidelines

- NEVER use generic gray colors
- Use primary brand color for brand elements
- ONLY extend Tailwind in `/tailwind.config.ts` or `/assets/css/tailwind.css`
- Use Tailwind Typography for prose content
- Support dark/light mode via `@nuxtjs/color-mode`

## Media handling
- ALWAYS store images in `/public/images/` with organized subdirectories:
  - Blog posts: `/public/images/posts/<post-slug>/image.jpg`
  - Products: `/public/images/products/product-name.jpg`
- ALWAYS reference with absolute paths: `![Alt text](mdc:images/posts/post-slug/image.jpg)`
- NEVER use relative paths for images
- Images are optimized via Nuxt Image

## Component styling
- Use scoped styles in Vue components
- Prefer Tailwind utility classes over custom CSS
- Follow existing component patterns
- NEVER add global styles outside designated files
