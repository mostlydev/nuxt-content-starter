# Development principles

- Prefer simple, focused solutions
- ALWAYS check for existing components before creating new ones
- ALWAYS use block component syntax in content files (*.md, *.mdc)
- Avoid code duplication; reuse existing patterns
- Make minimal changes needed to solve the problem
- Respect code organization and architectural patterns
- Keep code clean, readable, and well-organized
- Use Vue 3 Composition API for components
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Content changes should follow writing guidelines (see my-rules-for-content.mdc)

# Media and assets

- ALWAYS store images in correct location: `/public/images/`
- Organize content assets in subdirectories by content type (posts, products)
- Follow existing patterns for file naming
- NEVER reference assets from incorrect locations

# Workflow guidance

- Focus only on relevant code areas
- Test changes thoroughly 
- Consider side effects and impacts on other components
- Preserve existing functionality unless specifically changing it
- NEVER modify .env files without explicit confirmation
