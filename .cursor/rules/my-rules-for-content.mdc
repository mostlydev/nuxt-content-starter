- NEVER include placeholder or lorem ipsum text
- ALWAYS check medical terminology accuracy

## Markdown Component Structure Rules

- When working with custom components in markdown files:
- Always maintain proper nesting hierarchy with correct indentation
- Include a blank line before ALL component closure tags (::)
- For components like FullWidthSection that contain other elements:
    - First div should be positioned absolute for the hex pattern background
    - Second div must be positioned relative with z-index: 1
    - All content goes INSIDE the z-index: 1 div
- Button groups must follow this exact structure:

    ```md
    ::ProseButtonGroup
        ::ProseButton{to="/path" variant="primary"}
        Button Text
        ::
    ::
    ```

- NEVER close a component with double colons (::), each component gets exactly one opening and one closing tag
