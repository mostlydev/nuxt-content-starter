# Project tech stack

- Nuxt 3 with nuxt/content v3.3
- @nuxtjs/tailwindcss for styling
- @nuxt/image for optimization
- @nuxtjs/color-mode for theme support
- highlight.js, remark-mermaidjs for code and diagrams
- pnpm package manager for all package management

# Key files & directories

- `/content/` - Markdown files for all site content:
  - Main pages in root `/content/` (index.md, about.md)
  - Blog posts in `/content/posts/`
- `/public/images/` - Static images with subdirectories by content type
- `/components/content/` - MDC components (ContentBox, FullWidthSection, etc.)
- `/pages/[...slug].vue` - Dynamic routing for all content
- `/layouts/default.vue` - Main layout with navigation and footer
- `/assets/css/tailwind.css` - Custom CSS and Tailwind extensions
- `/nuxt.config.ts` - Module configuration (Content, Image, etc.)

# Content architecture

- "Content-first" approach with all content in Markdown/MDC files
- Automatic routing maps content paths to URLs:
  - `/content/about.md` → `/about`
  - `/content/posts/article.md` → `/posts/article`
- Content files use frontmatter for metadata
- SEO handled via useSeoMeta composable
- Custom components for rich content presentation via MDC syntax
- ALWAYS reference images with absolute paths from `/public`: `/images/posts/example.jpg`
